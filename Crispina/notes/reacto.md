1. Repeat the question - ask clarifying questions. Step through what you believe the question is asking with real inputs to make sure you have the right idea. Ask what to output if there are null or empty  inputs.

2. Examples  -  Create simple test cases, remember to use null or empty inputs. Ask yourself, "What input might be a challenge for my function?" Create several examples of inputs and expected outputs.

  EX: A fn to manipulate words in a string may have a challenge of punctuation and spaces.

3. Approach  - Think aloud on ideas of your approach. The interviewer might guide you to the best approach or you might happen upon the best approach while you are explaining your first thoughts. Use the example inputs to step through this approach. Remember to break the problem into smaller problems.

4. Code - ask the interviewer if your approach sounds good, then begin coding it. Don't forget to talk your ideas aloud.

5. Test - once you've coded out the body of your function, go back to your test cases and plug them in. DO NOT RUN YOUR CODE until you've checked for typos and thought of edge cases. Step through your code it with comments.

6. Optimize - think if there is any way to create an optimal solution. Many optimal solutions requre a data structure or named technique to help make the algo faster.
