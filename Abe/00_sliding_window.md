# Pattern: Sliding Window (11)

### Maximum Sum Subarray of Size K 
```
Problem Statement #
Given an array of positive numbers and a positive number ‘k’, 
find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of size ‘k’.

Example 1:

Input: [2, 1, 5, 1, 3, 2], k=3 
Output: 9
Explanation: Subarray with maximum sum is [5, 1, 3].
Example 2:

Input: [2, 3, 4, 1, 5], k=2 
Output: 7
Explanation: Subarray with maximum sum is [3, 4].
```

```javascript
function max_sub_array_of_size_k(k, arr) {
  let maxSum = 0;
  let windowSum = 0;
  let windowStart = 0;

  for (window_end = 0; window_end < arr.length; window_end++) {
    windowSum += arr[window_end]; // add the next element
    // slide the window, we don't need to slide if we've not hit the required window size of 'k'
    if (window_end - windowStart + 1 >= k) {
      maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, windowSum);
      windowSum -= arr[windowStart]; // subtract the element going out
      windowStart += 1; // slide the window ahead
    }
  }
  return maxSum;
}


console.log(`Maximum sum of a subarray of size K: ${max_sub_array_of_size_k(3, [2, 1, 5, 1, 3, 2])}`);
console.log(`Maximum sum of a subarray of size K: ${max_sub_array_of_size_k(2, [2, 3, 4, 1, 5])}`);
```

### Smallest Subarray with a given sum (easy): LC 209
```Problem Statement #
Given an array of positive numbers and a positive number ‘S’,
 find the length of the smallest contiguous subarray whose sum is
  greater than or equal to ‘S’. Return 0, if no such subarray exists.

Example 1:

Input: [2, 1, 5, 2, 3, 2], S=7 
Output: 2
Explanation: The smallest subarray with a sum great than or
 equal to '7' is [5, 2].
Example 2:

Input: [2, 1, 5, 2, 8], S=7 
Output: 1
Explanation: The smallest subarray with a sum greater 
than or equal to '7' is [8].
Example 3:

Input: [3, 4, 1, 1, 6], S=8 
Output: 3
Explanation: Smallest subarrays with a sum greater than or
 equal to '8' are [3, 4, 1] or [1, 1, 6].
 ```

```javascript
function smallest_subarray_with_given_sum(s, arr) {
  let windowSum = 0,
    minLength = Infinity,
    windowStart = 0;

  for (windowEnd = 0; windowEnd < arr.length; windowEnd++) {
    windowSum += arr[windowEnd]; // add the next element
    // shrink the window as small as possible until the 'window_sum' is smaller than 's'
    while (windowSum >= s) {
      minLength = Math.min(minLength, windowEnd - windowStart + 1);
      windowSum -= arr[windowStart];
      windowStart += 1;
    }
  }

  if (minLength === Infinity) {
    return 0;
  }
  return minLength;
}


console.log(`Smallest subarray length: ${smallest_subarray_with_given_sum(7, [2, 1, 5, 2, 3, 2])}`);
console.log(`Smallest subarray length: ${smallest_subarray_with_given_sum(7, [2, 1, 5, 2, 8])}`);
console.log(`Smallest subarray length: ${smallest_subarray_with_given_sum(8, [3, 4, 1, 1, 6])}`);

###Longest Substring with K Distinct Characters (medium): LC 340
```
Problem Statement #
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring in it 
with no more than K distinct characters.

Example 1:

Input: String="araaci", K=2
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest substring with no more than '2' distinct 
characters is "araa".
Example 2:

Input: String="araaci", K=1
Output: 2
Explanation: The longest substring with no more than '1' distinct 
characters is "aa".
Example 3:

Input: String="cbbebi", K=3
Output: 5
Explanation: The longest substrings with no more than '3' distinct 
characters are "cbbeb" & "bbebi".
 ```
```javascript
function longest_substring_with_k_distinct(str, k) {
  let windowStart = 0,
    maxLength = 0,
    charFrequency = {};

  // in the following loop we'll try to extend the range [window_start, window_end]
  for (let windowEnd = 0; windowEnd < str.length; windowEnd++) {
    const rightChar = str[windowEnd];
    if (!(rightChar in charFrequency)) {
      charFrequency[rightChar] = 0;
    }
    charFrequency[rightChar] += 1;
    // shrink the sliding window, until we are left with 'k' distinct characters in the char_frequency
    while (Object.keys(charFrequency).length > k) {
      const leftChar = str[windowStart];
      charFrequency[leftChar] -= 1;
      if (charFrequency[leftChar] === 0) {
        delete charFrequency[leftChar];
      }
      windowStart += 1; // shrink the window
    }
    // remember the maximum length so far
    maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, windowEnd - windowStart + 1);
  }

  return maxLength;
}


console.log(`Length of the longest substring: ${longest_substring_with_k_distinct('araaci', 2)}`);
console.log(`Length of the longest substring: ${longest_substring_with_k_distinct('araaci', 1)}`);
console.log(`Length of the longest substring: ${longest_substring_with_k_distinct('cbbebi', 3)}`);
```

### Fruits into Baskets (medium): LC 904
```Problem Statement #
Given an array of characters where each character represents a fruit tree,
 you are given two baskets and your goal is to put maximum number of fruits 
 in each basket. The only restriction is that each basket can have only one 
 type of fruit.

You can start with any tree, but once you have started you can’t skip a tree.
 You will pick one fruit from each tree until you cannot, i.e., you will 
 stop when you have to pick from a third fruit type.

Write a function to return the maximum number of fruits in both the baskets.

Example 1:

Input: Fruit=['A', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'C']
Output: 3
Explanation: We can put 2 'C' in one basket and one 'A' in the other from
 the subarray ['C', 'A', 'C']
Example 2:

Input: Fruit=['A', 'B', 'C', 'B', 'B', 'C']
Output: 5
Explanation: We can put 3 'B' in one basket and two 'C' in the other basket. 
This can be done if
 we start with the second letter: ['B', 'C', 'B', 'B', 'C']
```

Output: 2
Explanation: The longest substring without any repeating characters is "ab".
Example 3:

String Anagrams (hard) #
Given a string and a pattern, find all anagrams of the pattern in the given string.

Anagram is actually a Permutation of a string. For example, “abc” has the following six anagrams:
