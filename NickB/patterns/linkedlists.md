# Slow and fast

```javascript
function hasCycle(head) {
  let slow = head,
    fast = head;
  while (fast !== null && fast.next !== null) {
    slow = slow.next;
    fast = fast.next.next;
    if (slow === fast) {
      return true; // found the cycle
    }
  }
  return false;
}
```

- can help find cycles
  - find the distance of cycle
  - find the starting of cycle by finding distance and adding it to fast node and just moving up one slow and fast till they meet
- can help find the middle by just iterating if no cycle

## Reverse

- make sure handling null edge casses
- make sure not to lose a pointer to the next

```javascript
// running time O(n), space O(1)
function reverse(head) {
  let curr = head;
  let next = null;
  let prev = null;
  while (curr !== null) {
    next = curr.next;
    curr.next = prev;
    prev = curr;
    curr = next;
  }
  return prev;
}
```

## Rearrange a LinkedList

```
iven the head of a Singly LinkedList, write a method to modify the LinkedList such that the nodes from the second half of the LinkedList are inserted alternately to the nodes from the first half in reverse order. So if the LinkedList has nodes 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> null, your method should return 1 -> 6 -> 2 -> 5 -> 3 -> 4 -> null.

Your algorithm should not use any extra space and the input LinkedList should be modified in-place.
```

```javascript
//running time O(n), space O(1)
function reverse(head) {
  let prev = null;
  while (head !== null) {
    let next = head.next;
    head.next = prev;
    prev = head;
    head = next;
  }
  return prev;
}

function reorder(head) {
  if (head === null || head.next === null) {
    return;
  }

  // find middle of the LinkedList
  let slow = head,
    fast = head;
  while (fast !== null && fast.next !== null) {
    slow = slow.next;
    fast = fast.next.next;
  }

  // slow is now pointing to the middle node
  headSecondHalf = reverse(slow); // reverse the second half
  headFirstHalf = head;

  // rearrange to produce the LinkedList in the required order
  while (headFirstHalf !== null && headSecondHalf !== null) {
    temp = headFirstHalf.next;
    headFirstHalf.next = headSecondHalf;
    headFirstHalf = temp;

    temp = headSecondHalf.next;
    headSecondHalf.next = headFirstHalf;
    headSecondHalf = temp;
  }
  // set the next of the last node to 'null'
  if (headFirstHalf !== null) {
    headFirstHalf.next = null;
  }
}
```

# linked list in place reverse

```javascript
function reverse(head) {
  let current = head,
    previous = null;
  while (current !== null) {
    let next = current.next; // temporarily store the next node
    current.next = previous; // reverse the current node
    previous = current; // before we move to the next node, point previous to the current node
    current = next; // move on the next node
  }
  return previous;
}
```

    slow = slow.next;
    if (slow === fast) {
      // found the cycle
      cycle_length = calculate_cycle_length(slow);

  // increment both pointers until they meet at the start of the cycle

# Happy Number

function find_happy_number(num) {

# Cycle in a Circular Array

```
We are given an array containing positive and negative numbers. Suppose the array
 contains a number ‘M’ at a particular index. Now, if ‘M’ is positive we will move forward ‘M’ indices and if ‘M’ is negative move backwards ‘M’ indices. You
 should assume that the array is circular which means two things:

If, while moving forward, we reach the end of the array, we will jump to the
first element to continue the movement.
If, while moving backward, we reach the beginning of the array, we will jump to
the last element to continue the movement.
Write a method to determine if the array has a cycle. The cycle should have more
than one element and should follow one direction which means the cycle should not
contain both forward and backward movements.

Example 1:
```

```javascript
// O(N^1) and O(1)
function circular_array_loop_exists(arr) {
  for (i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    isForward = arr[i] >= 0; // if we are moving forward or not
    let slow = i,
      fast = i;

    // if slow or fast becomes '-1' this means we can't find cycle for this number
    while (true) {
      // move one step for slow pointer
      slow = find_next_index(arr, isForward, slow);
      // move one step for fast pointer
      fast = find_next_index(arr, isForward, fast);
      if (fast !== -1) {
        // move another step for the fast pointer
        fast = find_next_index(arr, isForward, fast);
      }
      if (slow === -1 || fast === -1 || slow === fast) {
        break;
      }
    }

    if (slow !== -1 && slow === fast) {
      return true;
    }
  }

  return false;
}

function find_next_index(arr, isForward, currentIndex) {
  direction = arr[currentIndex] >= 0;

  if (isForward !== direction) {
    return -1; // change in direction, return -1
  }

  nextIndex = (currentIndex + arr[currentIndex]) % arr.length;
  if (nextIndex < 0) {
    nextIndex += arr.length; // wrap around for negative numbers
  }

  // one element cycle, return -1
  if (nextIndex === currentIndex) {
    nextIndex = -1;
  }

  return nextIndex;
}
```
