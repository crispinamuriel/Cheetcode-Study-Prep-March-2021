# Slow and fast

```javascript
function isCycle(head) {
  let slow = head,
    fast = head;
  while (fast !== null && fast.next !== null) {
    slow = slow.next;
    fast = fast.next.next;
    if (slow === fast) {
      return true; // found the cycle
    }
  }
  return false;
}
```

- can help find cycles
  - find the distance of cycle
  - find the starting of cycle by finding distance and adding it to fast node and just moving up one slow and fast till they meet
- can help find the middle by just iterating if no cycle

## Reverse

```javascript
//running time O(n), space O(1)
function reverse(head) {
  let curr = head;
  let next = null;
  let prev = null;
  while (curr !== null) {
    next = curr.next;
    curr.next = prev;
    prev = curr;
    curr = next;
  }
  return prev;
}
```

## Rearrange a LinkedList

```javascript
//running time O(n), space O(1)
function reverse(head) {
  let prev = null;
  while (head !== null) {
    next = head.next;
    head.next = prev;
    prev = head;
    head = next;
  }
  return prev;
}

function reorder(head) {
  if (head === null || head.next === null) {
    return;
  }

  // find middle of the LinkedList
  let slow = head,
    fast = head;
  while (fast !== null && fast.next !== null) {
    slow = slow.next;
    fast = fast.next.next;
  }

  // slow is now pointing to the middle node
  headSecondHalf = reverse(slow); // reverse the second half
  headFirstHalf = head;

  // rearrange to produce the LinkedList in the required order
  while (headFirstHalf !== null && headSecondHalf !== null) {
    temp = headFirstHalf.next;
    headFirstHalf.next = headSecondHalf;
    headFirstHalf = temp;

    temp = headSecondHalf.next;
    headSecondHalf.next = headFirstHalf;
    headSecondHalf = temp;
  }
  // set the next of the last node to 'null'
  if (headFirstHalf !== null) {
    headFirstHalf.next = null;
  }
}
```

# linked list in place reverse

```javascript
function reverse(head) {
  let current = head,
    previous = null;
  while (current !== null) {
    let next = current.next; // temporarily store the next node
    current.next = previous; // reverse the current node
    previous = current; // before we move to the next node, point previous to the current node
    current = next; // move on the next node
  }
  return previous;
}
```
