# Top 'K' Numbers

Given an unsorted array of numbers, find the â€˜Kâ€™ largest numbers in it.

Note: For a detailed discussion about different approaches to solve this problem, take a look at Kth Smallest Number.

Example 1:

Input: [3, 1, 5, 12, 2, 11], K = 3
Output: [5, 12, 11]
Example 2:

Input: [5, 12, 11, -1, 12], K = 3
Output: [12, 11, 12]

```python
from heapq import *


def find_k_largest_numbers(nums, k):
  minHeap = []
  # put first 'K' numbers in the min heap
  for i in range(k):
    heappush(minHeap, nums[i])

  for i in range(k, len(nums)):
    if nums[i] > minHeap[0]:
      heappop(minHeap)
      heappush(minHeap, nums[i])

  return list(minHeap)


def main():

  print("Here are the top K numbers: " +
        str(find_k_largest_numbers([3, 1, 5, 12, 2, 11], 3)))

  print("Here are the top K numbers: " +
        str(find_k_largest_numbers([5, 12, 11, -1, 12], 3)))


main()
```
